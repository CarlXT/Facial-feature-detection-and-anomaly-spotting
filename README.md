# Facial-feature-detection-and-anomaly-spotting
Designed and implemented facial landmark analysis using key point detection techniques to compute facial angles and structural ratios. Results support use cases in medical screening, aesthetic planning, and anomaly recognition.
# Dependencies
1. OpenCV
2. Face Alignment
# Prerequisite
1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (e.g., OpenCV and face_alignment).
2. Provide an input image path by modifying the following line in the code:
   frame = cv2.imread('Test_images/image-1.jpeg')
#Output
